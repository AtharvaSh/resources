                Due to resistance some amount of heat is also dissipated in the circuit.

                It can be explained with the help of Joules law of heatng  
            </li>
            <li>
                Joules law of heating states that heat produced in a circuit is dirctly proportional to the 
                square of current flowing , resistance and time.

                Derivation of joules law of heating
            </li>
            <li>
                According to joule's law- <br>
                Heat ∝  I<sup>2</sup><br>
                Heat ∝  R<br>
                Heat∝ t<br>
                THat means <br>
                Heat∝I<sub>2</sub>Rt<br>
                Heat = I<sub>2</sub>Rt
